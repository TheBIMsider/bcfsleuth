## About BCF and Coordinates

The Building Collaboration Format (BCF) is an open file format that supports workflow communication in BIM processes. It enables issue tracking, coordination, and quality management across different software platforms. BCF viewpoint coordinates provide precise camera positioning information enabling spatial context for issues and comments.

**BCF Coordinate Standards:**
- **Camera Position**: 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) of camera location
- **Camera Direction**: Vector indicating camera viewing direction
- **Camera Up Vector**: Vector defining camera orientation
- **Field of View**: Perspective camera viewing angle
- **View to World Scale**: Orthogonal camera scaling factor

**Learn More**: [buildingSMART International](https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/bim-collaboration-format/)

## Support

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests including coordinate functionality
- **Documentation**: This guide and inline help with coordinate examples
- **Community**: AECO professional forums and coordinate workflow discussions
