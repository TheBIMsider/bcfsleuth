## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

BCFSleuth V2.0 is what happens when real-world AECO/BIM experience meets AI coding horsepower:

- **üß† AI Assistant**: Claude (Anthropic) helped with architecture ideas, cranked out code, and tracked down bugs  
- **‚ö° Fast Build**: Features that would‚Äôve taken months the old way came together in days  
- **üèóÔ∏è Domain Expertise**: 25+ years in AECO/BIM guiding the direction and keeping it practical  
- **üîÑ Iterative Workflow**: Build, test, tweak, repeat ‚Äî until it was rock-solid and ready to use  

The result? A capable, ready-to-work BCF management platform built faster than I thought possible.
