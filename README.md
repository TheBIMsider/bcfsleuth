## Overview

BCFSleuth is a client-side web application that extracts and converts BCF file data into hierarchical CSV formats for comprehensive analysis and reporting. Built with modern web technologies for fast, secure, browser-based processing.

## ✅ Phase 1 Complete - Key Features

- **BCF File Analysis**: Full support for BCF 2.0 and 2.1 formats
- **Comprehensive Data Extraction**: Topics, comments, viewpoints, and complete metadata
- **Hierarchical CSV Export**: Clean topic/comment structure with 25+ data fields
- **Client-Side Processing**: All file processing happens in your browser - no uploads to external servers
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple BCF files simultaneously
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Modern, intuitive file handling with real-time feedback
- **Cross-Platform**: Works perfectly in all modern browsers

## Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Drag and drop your BCF file(s) onto the upload area
3. Review the extracted data in the preview table
4. Click "Download CSV" to get your hierarchical export
5. Open in Excel for advanced analysis and filtering

### Supported BCF Data (25+ Fields)
- **Topic Information**: Title, Description, Status, Priority, Type, Stage
- **Author & Dates**: Creation/Modified authors and timestamps
- **Assignments**: Assigned users and due dates
- **Comments**: Full comment threads with authors, dates, and content
- **Project Metadata**: BCF version, project names, source files
- **Viewpoints**: 3D viewpoint counts and references
- **Labels & Categories**: Topic categorization and tagging

### Export Format
BCFSleuth generates a hierarchical CSV structure:
```
Row Type | Topic Data...                    | Comment Data...
Topic    | HVAC Issue, High Priority, etc. | [empty]
Comment  | [empty]                         | Comment 1, Author, Date, Text
Comment  | [empty]                         | Comment 2, Author, Date, Text
```

This format allows easy filtering and analysis in Excel while preserving the topic/comment relationships.
