## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

BCFSleuth V2.0 is what happens when real-world AECO/BIM experience meets AI coding horsepower:

- **🧠 AI Assistant**: Claude (Anthropic) helped with architecture ideas, cranked out code, and tracked down bugs  
- **⚡ Fast Build**: Features that would've taken months the old way came together in days  
- **🏗️ Domain Expertise**: 25+ years in AECO/BIM guiding the direction and keeping it practical  
- **🔄 Iterative Workflow**: Build, test, tweak, repeat — until it was rock-solid and ready to use  

The result? A capable, ready-to-work BCF management platform built faster than I thought possible

## What BCFSleuth Does

BCFSleuth is a modern, web-based evolution of BCF management tools like the original Sloth. It processes BCF files entirely in your browser - no uploads, no accounts, complete privacy. Drag in your BCF files and get instant access to data analysis, image management, viewpoint coordinate extraction, and professional reports.

**Universal BCF Support**: Handles all BCF formats (2.0, 2.1, 3.0) with intelligent format detection and adaptation.
